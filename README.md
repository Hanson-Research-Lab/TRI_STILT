# TRI_STILT


Running TRI STILT Simulations


1. Want to be able to run the simulations then automatically trigger post processing where files are visualized and quantified in order to act as feedback mechanism. This requires batching the simulations then running them through a postprocessing step (on CHPC) where data, figures and metrics can all be collected.
